Objective: Smooth and Faster, Longer,  Less Tiered, Less Stroke


1. Breakdown the freestyle swimming? 
2. How to swim and how not to swim in techniqueâ€™s prespective and slow/fast swimming?
3. Strength, mobility/range of motion, warmup required for neck, shoulder, arms, core, hips, Legs(Quad, Harmstring, Calf, Ankle)?
4. How to breath?
5. How to kick ?
6. How to training: Routine (slow, tempo, fast, HIIT, Active rest)?
7. Drill and training outside swimming pool?

Physics of Swimming:
1. First law of motion: Resting body wants to stay at rest, and it takes energy to get moving. Don't over glide.
2. Second law of motion: Minimizes drag and Maximizes propulsion.

Breaks down the freestyle stroke into six parts:
1. Extension
  - Keep your hands relaxed with your fingers slightly apart.
  - Reach as far forward as possible with your relaxed hands.
  - Keep your hands slightly beneath the water surface and your forearm slightly lower than your shoulder.
  - Don't go over the centerline from the extension.
2. Catch
  - Imagine you're reaching over a barrel to initiate the catch.
  - Slightly break your wrist and elbow as if reaching over something round in front of you.
  - Maintain a high elbow position throughout the catch.
  - Don't rush through the catch.
  - Drop your elbow.
3. Pull
  - Maintain a high elbow throughout the entire pull phase.
  - Imagine the water under your forearm and hand, and your body moving over the top of your hand.
  - Allow this process of the pull to happen without rushing.
  - Don't rush the pull thinking it will make you go faster.
4. Finish
  - Extend your arm down so your wrist gets towards your hips for a final push.
  - Slightly speed up this phase to move into the recovery phase.
  - Don't Rush this phase.
5. Recovery
  - Carry some of the momentum from the finish into the recovery.
  - Relax everything, especially your shoulder muscles.
  - Rotate your body first to create space for a smooth exit of the recovering arm.
  - Elbow exits the water first, followed by your forearm and hand.
  - Point your elbow high and keep your hand relaxed and close to your body.
  - Hand takes over halfway through the recovery.
  - Maintain a high elbow throughout the recovery for a smoother and more balanced Freestyle stroke.
6. Hand entry
  - Keep your fingers pointed so they enter the water first.
  - Minimize the splash as you enter the water.
  - Imagine your hand, wrist, and elbow going into the water through one hole.
  - Combine this with the rotation as your hand comes forward.
  - Make sure your hand enters the water above your shoulder and not too wide.
  - Don't enter the water too early.


Mistakes swimmers make in freestyle are:
1. Looking forward. Instead of looking forward, keep your head down and look at the bottom of the pool.
2. Kicking too much. Kicking should be short and fast, with the focus on hip rotation rather than amplitude.
3. Shouldn't hold your breath while swimming. Exhale slowly through nose(underwater), inhale quickly through their mouth (turning their head to breathe).
4. Crossover: crossing the midline of your body with your hand during the arm stroke.
5. Pulling with a straight arm. Bend the elbow and pul with an early vertical forearm.

Attention to details:
1. Minimize Darg:
2. Maximize Propulsion:
