Lessons learned from heartbreak...

Slef-worth,

I think you know that we often get into relationships and put a lot of our self-worth into these other people. And when they disappoint you, as you know they will, you realize how to be independent and value yourself on your own without needing someone else.

You should allow yourself to get swept away a little bit by being in love because it's one of the best feelings in the world. 

With the high of being in love, there's inevitably the low of being heartbroken. But I believe that's a necessary human experience. Being heartbroken is important because you learn a lot of lessons about yourself and others. 

I think you should allow yourself to get stuck a little bit. Feel the emotions you're supposed to feel with being heartbroken because it's going to be tough. It's going to feel like nothing you've ever felt before. But it's important to feel that. And it's important to have that experience because if you run away from it, you'll never truly get over it.

And you lost your innocence and became cold-hearted.
