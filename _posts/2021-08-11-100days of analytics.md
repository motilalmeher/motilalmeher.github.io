Statistician and Machine Learning engineer roles have in common is that they both provide high-effort solutions to specific problems. If the problems they tackle aren’t worth solving, you end up wasting their time and your money. A frequent lament among business leaders is, “Our data science group is useless.” And the problem usually lies in an absence of analytics expertise. Statisticians and machine learning engineers are narrow-and-deep workers — the shape of a rabbit hole, incidentally — so it’s really important to point them at problems that deserve the effort. If your experts are carefully solving the wrong problems, your investment in data science will suffer low returns. To ensure that you can make good use of narrow-and-deep experts, you either need to be sure you already have the right problem or you need a wide-and-shallow approach to finding one. Wide-and-shallow experts means, I am talking about analyst.

I am tired of finding good consolidated resources to develop the wide and shallow problem solving skill(Industry wise and function wise). And that is very important as I have mentioned above. So I am consolidating all my learning to a 100 days of series of posts where I will discuss about different business use cases industry wise(BFSI, Retail,e-Commerce, Media, Health Care and Pharma etc...) and function wise(Customer analytics, Marketing analytics, Operation analytics, Sales analytics, Digital analytic etc... ) and analytics approach to solve those problems using different tools. Here I will focous on Wide and Shallow skillsets.
