Why i am writting this?
journal my feelings,
To build a routine
for people.

why it is difficult.

It's 2017, everything changed in my life. I was in a relation with a girl from last 3 year. She was a juniour in my college and classmate in my school. Yes, you read it right. We were classmate in school from L kg to class 10. But I had not even know her till class 5th when we shared same section. From then I had something about her in my heart. As a person I was a very curious boy, intrested to learn and try everything. I was very happy with what ever I was doing that time. My parents never denied me to do anything i wanted to. With that little knowledgen I create things in my mind imagine it work hard for it and achive it.
