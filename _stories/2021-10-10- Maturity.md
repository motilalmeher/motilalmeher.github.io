## What is the best definition of maturity?

You propose a girl and she accepts your proposal without hesitating because she too had a crush on you.Now you both start living moments together and enjoy each other’s company.You both are happily living with each other.


But one day, you find that your girlfriend is cheating on you. So you decide to talk on this matter and you both break up with each other.Now, you both are separated and you hate her for breaking your trust.

But you don’t keep bashing her all the time you meet your friends or any stranger.
Whenever someone asks you about her, you just deviate the topic by saying what’s done is done now and there’s nothing good to talk about someone who isn’t with you anymore.

You know her secrets, her lies, and how bad a person she was but you still respect her privacy as a human being.
You got separated doesn’t mean you’ll disrespect them or don’t respect their privacy.
