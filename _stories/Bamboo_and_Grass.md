There was a businessman. His business sunk and he was too much hopeless. He was tired of his life and deeply frustrated.One day he went to jungle and sat their silently. He was sad. He asked to God - “ God, I have lost everything and got defeated in my life. Now, Why should I be alive? Why Should I not frustrated? Please Help me God?

God answered - “ See the Grass and Bamboo tree. Both of them started their journey of life together. I given them equal amount of light, water and air. I also provided good care to both.Grass started growing fast and land around became greener day by day but bamboo seed was not even germinated. Second year, The grass became more greener and dense but still bamboo seed remained as it was. But, I was hopeful and didn’t lose my patience.As two more year passed the grass created a beautiful scene all over from its greenery but bamboo remained same. Still I kept patience. After five year, bamboo seed germinated into a small plant. it was small and weak in comparison to grassland but in a short span of 6 months bamboo tree gained a height of 100 feet. The bamboo tree took 5 years to strengthen it’s roots so that it could bear the weight and height of itself.

Whenever you feel that your life is full of struggle, you must understand that your roots are getting stronger so that it become eligible to carry greater success.
I didn't lose my patience for 5 years as bamboo tree was not growing and also I will not loose my patience upon you, so how can you?

Don’t compare yourself from anyone. Off course, The very purpose and time of every being is different from each other.
Your time will come too. You will also gain height like bamboo tree. Keep patience and don’t afraid from struggle.”
