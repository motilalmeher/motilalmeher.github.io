Minimizing churn is one of the keys to success for a subscription media or commerce business. Loyal customers create predictable and compounding revenue for your business. If you can’t predict and prevent churn, you’ll spend a fortune trying to constantly acquire new users.

Machine Learning is empowering businesses to develop more forward-thinking retention strategies than ever before. As a result, subscription-driven companies use machine learning to predict and prevent customer churn.

## What is customer churn? ##

Customer churn (or customer attrition) is a tendency of customers to abandon a brand and stop being a paying client of a particular business. The percentage of customers that discontinue using a company’s products or services during a particular time period is called a customer churn (attrition) rate.Churn rate is a health indicator for businesses whose customers are subscribers and paying for services on a recurring basis.

There are many things brands may do wrong, from complicated onboarding when customers aren’t given easy-to-understand information about product usage and its capabilities to poor communication, e.g. the lack of feedback or delayed answers to queries. Another situation: Longtime clients may feel unappreciated because they don’t get as many bonuses as the new ones.In general, it’s the overall customer experience that defines brand perception and influences how customers recognize value for money of products or services they use.


## Use cases for customer churn prediction ##

As we mentioned before, churn rate is one of the critical performance indicators for subscription businesses. Let’s take a quick look at some companies with subscription business model:

**Music and video streaming services** are probably the most commonly associated with the subscription business model (Netflix, YouTube, Apple Music, Google Play, Spotify, Amazon Video, etc.).

**Media:** Digital presence is a must among the press, so news companies offer readers digital subscriptions besides print ones (Bloomberg, The Guardian, Financial Times, The New York Times, Medium etc.).

**Telecom companies (cable or wireless):** These companies may provide a full range of products and services, including wireless network, internet, TV, cell phone, and home phone services (AT&T, Sprint, Verizon, Cox Communications, etc.). Some specialize in mobile telecommunications (China Mobile, Vodafone, T-Mobile, etc.).

**Software as a service providers:** The adoption of cloud-hosted software is growing. According to Gartner, the SaaS market remains the largest segment of the cloud market. Its revenue is expected to grow 17.8 percent and reach $85.1 billion in 2019. The product range of SaaS providers is extensive: graphic and video editing (Adobe Creative Cloud, Canva), accounting (Sage 50cloud, FreshBooks), eCommerce (BigCommerce, Shopify), email marketing (MailChimp, Zoho Campaigns), and many others.

## Identifying at-risk customers with machine learning: ##

Companies that constantly monitor how people engage with products, encourage clients to share opinions, and solve their issues promptly have greater opportunities to maintain mutually beneficial client relationships.

And now imagine a company that has been gathering customer data for a while, so it can use it to identify behavior patterns of potential churners, segment these at-risk customers, and take appropriate actions to gain back their trust.Those following a proactive approach to customer churn management use predictive analytics. 

“The one weakness of tracking just real churn is that it serves only as a lagging indicator of poor customer experience, which is where a predictive churn model becomes extremely valuable.”

The main trait of machine learning is building systems capable of finding patterns in data, learning from it without explicit programming. In the context of customer churn prediction, these are behavior characteristics that indicate decreasing customer satisfaction from using company services/products.

To identifying potential churners, machine learning algorithms can do a great job here. They reveal some shared behavior patterns of those customers who have already left the company. Then, ML algorithms check the behavior of current customers against such patterns and signal if they discover potential churners.

Subscription-based businesses leverage ML for predictive analytics to find out which current users aren’t fully satisfied with their services and address their issues when it’s not too late.
